    /* Variables & Data Types */

//Question 1: There are 8 Primitive Data Types in JavaScript, list them all 
//Note: Arrays and Objects are not primitive data-types
//Answer: i think they are 7; i don't know about 8th one 
/*NN : null and number 
SS : string and Symbol
BB : boolean and bignint
U : undefined ;*/


//Question 2: Is JavaScript a dynamically typed Language? or a Statically typed language?
//Answer: javascript is dynamically typed language 

//Question 3: Variable Scoping
// Part 1 - What 2 types of scope can variables declared with the "var" keyword have?
//Answer:

//Part 2 - As of ES6 JavaScript has 2 new variable declaration keywords: "let" and "const".  
//How are let and const variables scoped?
//Answer: Globally and localy 

//Part 3 - What is the difference between "let" and "const"? Hint: it has to do with variable reassignment
//Answer: let is blocked scoped which means it be updated  inside a block, and const is also blocked scoped which can  neither can be updated or re-declared ;


//Question 4:

//Part 1: Read the code written below. What is wrong with the code?

/*var carBrandOne = "Ford";
let carBrandOne = "Mercedes";*/

// comment out the code above and write a correction to the code below this  line
var carBrandOne = "Ford";
carBrandOne = "Mercedes";

//Part 2: Read the code written below. What is wrong with the code?
/*const myConstant = {id: 1, name: "Joe", favoriteSnack: "ice cream"}
myConstant = 10;*/

// comment out the code above and write a correction to the code below this  line
let myConstant = {
    id: 1,
     name: "Joe",
     favoriteSnack: "ice cream"
}
myConstant = 10;

// Part 3: Read the code written below. What will happen? Will this throw an error?
const myConstant2 = {id: 2, name: "Bill", favoriteSnack: "potato chips"}
myConstant2["name"] = "James"

//Part 4: Read the code written below. Look at the function call below the defined function,
// Will declaring a let variables with the same name throw an error in this case? Why or why not?
// Answer: absolutly not, that is beacuse let is a blocked level scoped 
// What will the function return?

function variablesExample(number){
    let returnMessage = '';
    if(number > 10){
        let message = "the given number is larger than 10";
        returnMessage = message;
    }else if(number === 10){
        let message = "the given number is equvalent to 10";
        returnMessage = message;
    }else{
        let message = "the given number is less than 10";
        returnMessage = message;

    }
    console.log(returnMessage);
    return returnMessage;
}
variablesExample(15);

//Question 5: 

// Part-1: What are acceptable characters that you can use to start variable names?
//Answer: letters, digits, underscores, & $ sign allowed,
// Case Senstivity 
// the better way to name a variable is to use Camel case 

//Part-2: What are acceptable characters that you can use to name variables (after the first character of the name)?
// Answer: UpperCase like a good exmple will be ; const  myName = "Zohra";


/* END OF VARIABLES AND STRINGS SECTION */



/* Strings */

// Given the string below,
// Part 1 - Write code that will return the 8th character of the string
// Part 2 - Then write code that will return (or console.log) "is a"
// Note - don't convert this string to an array
let coolString = "Hello World is a tradition";

//Part 3
// How would you return the 4th from the last character from the coolString without just hard coding the index of that character?

//Part 4
// Look at the variables below that have been initialized with string data.  
//What are the 2 ways you can concatinate these strings together?
/*let aString = "Back to "
let bString = "The Future"*/

//Write the 2 ways of concatinating the strings below this line.  Declare a new variable for the results.
//Answer:
//By + (String concatenation) operator.
//By concat() method.
// First Method
let aString = "Back to "
let bString = "The Future"
let result = aString + bString;
console.log(result);
// Second method
let fString = "Back to "
let jString = "The Future"
let secondresult = Stringf.concat(jString);

/*For Loops */
// You are provided an array of strings below
// an example of a console.log is also provided

let namesArray = ["Joe", "Larry", "Bob", "James", "David", "Tim", "Jimmy", "Jessie", "Marty"];
console.log(namesArray["The first name is: ", 0]);

/*directly below this comment, 
write a for loop that iterates over the namesArray from the beginning to the end of the array and logs the names to the console */
for(let i = 0; i<namesArray.length; i++){
    console.log(namesArray[i]);
}

//write a for loop that iterates over the namesArray from the END to the BEGINnING of the array and logs the names to the console
for(let j = namesArray; j > 0; j--){
    console.log(namesArray[j]);
}


//write a for loop that iterates over the namesArray BUT only logs every other name to the console
let i = 0;
while(i < namesArray.length){
    console.log(namesArray[i]);
    i++;
}



/*While Loops*/

// Inside the function below, Write a while loop that will console.log("Hello World") "number" times.  Use continueBoolean in your while loop's specified condition

function whileLoopQuestion1(number){
    while( continueBoolean = true){
        console.log("Hello World")
    }
    
    
}

whileLoopQuestion1(20);


/* Array Methods */

//What does the Array.prototype.push() method do? What does it return?
// Answer : adds up a new element to the array, and returns that element back, or the new length of the array

//What does the Array.prototype.unshift() method do? What does it return?
// Answer : removes the first item of an array and return the new length of the array

//What does the Array.prototype.pop() method do? What does it return?
// Answer : removes the last item of an array and returns that value to the caller array

//What does the Array.prototype.shift() method do? What does it return?
// Answer : removes the first item of an array and returns that element

// What does the Array.prototype.join() method do? What does the 1 optional parameter do to modify how this method works? What does it return?
/*Answer : when we have multi array elements and wants them to be all in one, so here is where the .join() methods comes in, 
.join() method simply joins all the elements of an array amd make it one
and the parameter Specifies a string to separate each pair of adjacent elements of the array */



//What does the Array.prototype.slice() method do? What will it return?
// Answer : Slice is used to get a new array from the original array, the syntax looks something like this
// .slice(start, end);


//What does the Array.prototype.splice() method do? What will it return?
// Answer :  splice is used to add/remove items in the original array. 
// Syntax : .splice(indexPosition, how many add/delete, new value, )  kinda not sure :)











//Look at the Array Below
//let nestedArray = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [[10,11,12],[13,14,15],[16,17,18]], 19];
//How many dimensions does this array have?
//Answer : by using recursion we can get the number of dimensions of the array
function getArrayDepth(ry){
  // number of levels: how deep is the array
  let levels = 1;
  // previous length
  let prev_length = 1;
  // current length
  let curr_length = ry.length;
  //if the resulting array is longer than the previous one  add a new level
  while(curr_length > prev_length){
  ry = ry.flat();
  prev_length = curr_length
  curr_length = ry.length;
  levels ++
  }
  return levels;
}


let nestedArray = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [[10,11,12],[13,14,15],[16,17,18]],[19,20,21], 19];
console.log(getArrayDepth(nestedArray)); // returns 4



//How would you access the value 11?
console.log(nestedArray[3][0][1]);

// how would you access the value 5?
console.log(nestedArray[1][1]);

// How would you access the last element in the array without knowing the array's length?
// Answer : By using (array.length-1)
// example : const lastItem = nestedArray[nestedArray.length-1];
// console.log(lastItem)


// How would you access the 3rd element in the array?  What will that element's value be?
let nestedArray = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [[10,11,12],[13,14,15],[16,17,18]], 19];
console.log(nestedArray[2]);











/* Functions */

/* Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
The formula to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit is the temperature in Celsius times 9/5, plus 32.

write a function named convertCtoF.
 function  convertCtoF(){

}

The function should take 1 argument.
The parameter should be named celsius. 

function  convertCtoF(celsuis){

}


Your function needs to accept an argument of a temperature in Celsius, and return the equivalent temperature in Fahrenheit
Use the formula mentioned above to help convert the Celsius temperature to Fahrenheit.

 function  convertCtoF(celsuis){

let fahrenheit = (celsuis * 9/5)+32;
return fahrenheit;
}
convertCtoF(30);
convertCtoF(30); should return 86;

*/
function convertCtoF(celsius) {
    let fahrenheit = (celsius * 9/5)+32;
    return fahrenheit;
}
convertCtoF(30);
